# Prepare Your Database
Configure your database for use with Nodestream.


In this tutorial, we'll walk you through preparing your database for use with Nodestream.


## Database Migrations

Nodestream uses a concept called "database migrations" to manage changes to your database schema over time.
Despite graph databases generally not having an enforced schema, `nodestream` uses a schema to define the structure of your data.
Additionally, it uses migrations to suggest indexes and constraints to the database to improve performance and data integrity (e.g. unique constraints) where the database supports it.
As your application evolves, you'll need to make changes to your database schema to accommodate new features or bug fixes.
In nodestream this is achieved by making changes to your pipelines file.
Nodestream will then generate the necessary migrations for you.

## Generating Database Migrations

To generate a new migration, run the following command:

```bash
nodestream migrations make
```

When you run this command, Nodestream will generate a new migration file in the `migrations` directory of your project.
The file will contain a list of operations that need to be performed to bring your database schema up to date.
In the case of a new project, the migration will contain the operations to create the initial schema.

The output of the command will look something like this:

```plaintext
Which will produce output like this:

Generated migration 20240209081151.
The migration contains 4 schema changes.
  - Create node type Employee
  - Add additional index for node type Employee on field last_ingested_at
  - Create relationship type REPORTS_TO
  - Add additional index for relationship type REPORTS_TO on field last_ingested_at
Migration written to migrations/20240209081151.yaml
Run `nodestream migrations run` to apply the migration.
```

## Configuring Your Database Connection

Before you can run the migrations or a pipeline, you'll need to configure your database connection.
To do this, open the `nodestream.yaml` file in the root of your project and add you should see a section like this:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="neo4j"
    values={[
        {label: 'neo4j', value: 'neo4j'},
        {label: 'Amazon Neptune', value: 'neptune'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="neo4j">
        ```yaml
        targets:
          my-db:
            database: neo4j
            password: neo4j123
            uri: bolt://localhost:7687
            username: neo4j
        ```
        Replace the `uri`, `username`, and `password` with the connection details for your database.

        If you just want to get up and running quickly, you can use run this docker command to start a local Neo4j instance with the same default credentials:

        ```bash
        docker run \
            --restart always \
            --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
            --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/neo4j123 \
            --env NEO4J_PLUGINS='["apoc","bloom"]' \
            neo4j:5
        ```

        **WARNING:** Do not use the default credentials or credentials that are stored in your source code in a production (or really any) environment. Always use environment variables or a secrets manager to store your credentials. Read more about this [here](../../tutorials-intermediate/configuring-projects).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="neptune">
        ```yaml
        targets:
          my-neptune-db:
            database: neptune
            mode: database
            host: https://[NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT]:[PORT]
          my-neptune-analytics:
            database: neptune
            mode: analytics
            graph_id: [GRAPH_IDENTIFIER]
        ```
        Set the `mode` to your desired flavor of Neptune, and replace either the `host` or `graph_id` with the connection details for your database.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note 

Always check the database specific documentation for all prerequisites and configuration options [here](../../category/database-support).

## Running Migrations

To run the migrations we just created, run the following command:

```bash
nodestream migrations run --target my-db
```

When you run this command, Nodestream will apply all pending migrations to your database and bring your schema up to date.

The output of the command will look something like this:

```plaintext
 - Migrations executed on target my-db.
```

That's it! Your database is now ready to use with Nodestream.
