# Extending the CLI

The Nodestream CLI is built to be extensible.
You can add new functionality to the CLI to suit your development needs.
You can either include these customizations an a [plugin](./building-plugins) or as a part of your own codebase.

## Audits
Audits are a way to run a series checks on your project.
For instance, you can build an audit to check that naming conventions are being followed, or that certain fields are present in your data.


### Creating an Audit

Audits are implemented as a class that inherits from `nodestream.project.audits:Audit`.

```python
from nodestream.project import Project
from nodestream.project.audits import Audit

class MyAudit(Audit):
    name = "my-audit"

    async def run(self, project: Project):
        # Your audit logic here
        pass
```

The `Audit` base class has several methods that you can call to report the results of your audit.

- `self.success(message: str)` - Report a successful audit finding
- `self.failure(message: str)` - Report a failed audit finding
- `self.warning(message: str)` - Report a warning audit finding

For example, you can check that a certain field is present in every type definition in your schema:

```python
from nodestream.project import Project

class FieldPresenceAudit(Audit):
    name = "field-presence"
    description = "Check that a certain field is present in every type definition"

    async def run(self, project: Project):
        schema = project.get_schema()
        for node_type in schema.node_types:
            if "my_field" not in node_type.properties:
                self.failure(f"Field 'my_field' is missing from {node_type.name}")

        if self.failure_count == 0:
            self.success("All node types have the 'my_field' field")
```

### Registering an Audit

Audits are registered via the [entry_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins) API of a Python Package.
Specifically, the `entry_point` named `audits` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded.
The entry point provided should be a module which has atleast one subclass of `nodestream.project.audits:Audit` as directed above.
Each subclass will be registered as an audit. The `name` attribute of the class will be used as the name of the audit.

Depending on how you are building your package, you can register your audit plugin in one of the following ways:


<Tabs
  defaultValue="pyproject"
  values={[
    {label: 'pyproject.toml', value: 'pyproject'},
    {label: 'poetry', value: 'poetry'},
    {label: 'setup.cfg', value: 'setup-cfg'},
    {label: 'setup.py', value: 'setup-py'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pyproject">
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."nodestream.plugins"]
    audits = "my_python_package.audits"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry">
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."nodestream.plugins"]
    audits = "my_python_package.audits"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-cfg">
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        audits = my_python_package.audits
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-py">
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points = {
            'nodestream.plugins': [
                'audits = nodestream_plugin_cool.audits',
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running an Audit

Once you have registered your audit, you can run it using the `nodestream audit` command.

```bash
nodestream audit my-audit
```

:::note

You must run the command from an environment that has your package installed so that the entry point is registered.

## Creating a Command

Commands are a more general way to extend the CLI.
You can create a command to perform any action you need.
Commands are built on top of [cleo](https://cleo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python package for building command-line applications.

### Creating a Command

Commands are implemented as a class that inherits from `nodestream.cli:NodestreamCommand`.

```python
from cleo.helpers import option

from nodestream.cli import NodestreamCommand

class MyCommand(NodestreamCommand):
    name = "my-command"
    description = "My custom command"
    options = [option("my-option", None, "My custom option")]

    async def handle_async(self):
        # Your command logic here
        pass
```

Similar to audits, you may want to work with the project in your command.
Access to the project is provided via the `get_project` method.
You will have to add the project option to your command to allow users to override the project path.

```python
from nodestream.cli import NodestreamCommand
from nodestream.cli.commands.shared_options import PROJECT_FILE_OPTION

class MyCommand(NodestreamCommand):
    name = "my-command"
    description = "My custom command"
    options = [PROJECT_FILE_OPTION]

    async def handle_async(self):
        project = self.get_project()
        # Your command logic here
        pass
```

### Registering a Command

Commands are registered via the [entry_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins) API of a Python Package.
Specifically, the `entry_point` named `commands` inside of the `nodestream.plugins` group is loaded.
The entry point provided should be a module which has atleast one subclass of `nodestream.cli:NodestreamCommand` as directed above.
Each subclass will be registered as a command.

Depending on how you are building your package, you can register your commands plugin in one of the following ways:


<Tabs
  defaultValue="pyproject"
  values={[
    {label: 'pyproject.toml', value: 'pyproject'},
    {label: 'poetry', value: 'poetry'},
    {label: 'setup.cfg', value: 'setup-cfg'},
    {label: 'setup.py', value: 'setup-py'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pyproject">
    ```toml
    [project.entry-points."nodestream.plugins"]
    commands = "my_python_package.commands"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry">
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.plugins."nodestream.plugins"]
    commands = "my_python_package.commands"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-cfg">
    ```ini
    [options.entry_points]
    nodestream.plugins =
        commands = my_python_package.commands
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setup-py">
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        # ...,
        entry_points = {
            'nodestream.plugins': [
                'commands = nodestream_plugin_cool.commands',
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running a Command

Once you have registered your command, you can run it using the `nodestream` command.

```bash
nodestream my-command
```

:::note

You must run the command from an environment that has your package installed so that the entry point is registered.
